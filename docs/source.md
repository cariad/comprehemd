# ü§î CompreheMD

**CompreheMD** is a Python package for parsing Markdown documents.

<edition value="toc" />


## Installation

CompreheMD requires Python 3.8 or later.

Install CompreheMD via pip:

```bash
pip install comprehemd
```

## MarkdownParser class

### Parsing a stream

_The Markdown document parsed in this example is [example.md](https://cariad.github.io/comprehemd/example.md)._

To read an entire text stream, call `.read(reader: IO[str])`. The method yields [blocks](#blocks-classes) until the stream ends.

```python
from comprehemd import MarkdownParser

with open("docs/example.md", "r") as fp:
    for block in MarkdownParser().read(fp):
        print(block)
```

<!--edition-exec-->

### Parsing chunks

The parser can be fed ad-hoc chunks of Markdown. The `.feed(chunk: str)` method yields all the [blocks](#blocks-classes) that the chunk completed.

After feeding the final chunk, you must call `.close()` to flush and yield any buffered blocks.

```python
from comprehemd import CodeBlock, HeadingBlock, MarkdownParser

def tease(chunk: str) -> None:
    escaped = chunk.replace("\n", "\\n")
    for block in parser.feed(chunk):
        print(f'After "{escaped}", the parser yielded:')
        print(block)
        print()
    else:
        print(f'After "{escaped}", the parser did not yield.')
        print()


parser = MarkdownParser()

tease("# Feeding exam")
tease("ple\n\nThis de")
tease("monstrates chu")
tease("nked feeding.")

for block in parser.close():
    print("After closing, the parser yielded:")
    print(block)
    print()

```

## Outline class

### Generating an outline from a stream

_The Markdown document parsed in this example is [example.md](https://cariad.github.io/comprehemd/example.md)._

The `Outline` class keeps track of headings to generate an outline of a Markdown document.

The simplest way to generate an outline is to pass a text stream into the `read_outline()` function:

```python
from comprehemd import read_outline, OutlineItem

with open("docs/example.md", "r") as fp:
    outline = read_outline(fp)

def log(indent: int, item: OutlineItem) -> None:
    indent_str = "  " * indent
    print(f"{indent_str}{item.block}")
    for child in item.children:
        log(indent+1, child)

for item in outline.root:
    log(0, item)
```

<!--edition-exec-->

### Generating an outline via a MarkdownParser

_The Markdown document parsed in this example is [example.md](https://cariad.github.io/comprehemd/example.md)._

If you're already parsing a document and would prefer to generate the outline as you go rather than read the document again then you can add headings manually:

```python
from comprehemd import (
    HeadingBlock,
    MarkdownParser,
    Outline,
    OutlineItem,
)

outline = Outline()

with open("docs/example.md", "r") as fp:
    for block in MarkdownParser().read(fp):
        if isinstance(block, HeadingBlock):
            outline.add(block)

def log(indent: int, item: OutlineItem) -> None:
    indent_str = "  " * indent
    print(f"{indent_str}{item.block}")
    for child in item.children:
        log(indent+1, child)

for item in outline.root:
    log(0, item)
```

<!--edition-exec-->

#### Rendering an outline

An outline can be rendered to Markdown by either treating the instance as a string or by calling `.render(writer: IO[str])`.

```python
from comprehemd import read_outline, OutlineItem

with open("docs/example.md", "r") as fp:
    outline = read_outline(fp)

print(outline)
```

<!--edition-exec-->

## Blocks classes

### Block

The `Block` class is the base of all blocks.

- `source` returns the original Markdown source for the block.
- `text` returns the meaningful text representation of the block.

### CodeBlock

The `CodeBlock` class represents a code block.

- `language` returns the language hint if one was specified.
- The block can be rendered back to Markdown by calling `render(writer: IO[str], fence: Fence)`.

### EmptyBlock

`EmptyBlock` represents an empty line.

### HeadingBlock

The `HeadingBlock` class represents a heading.

- `anchor` returns the heading's anchor.
- `level` returns the heading's level (i.e. 1 for the top-most heading, down to 6 for the lowest).
